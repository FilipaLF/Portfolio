    "In this project, the medical insurance costs of a representative dataset were investigated using Python. The medical information gathered for each patient to determine the insurance cost were age, sex, bmi, number of children, smoker status, region of origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has a population of 1338 patients, consisting of 662 women and 676 men.\n",
    "The age average is 39 years with a standard deviation of 14.0, being the oldest patients 64 years old and the younger patients 18 years old.\n",
    "\n",
    "Patients are spread around four regions in the USA: southwest, southeast, northwest, northeast.\n",
    "There are 325 patients from Southwest, 364 from Southeast, 325 from Northwest and 324 from Northeast.\n",
    "\n",
    "One key parameter for insurance cost is the smoking status of a patient. There are 274 smokers and 1064 non-smokers.\n",
    "Regarding the smoker population, 115 are female with an average insurance cost of 30679.0$ and 159 are male smokers with an average insurance cost of 33042.01$.\n",
    "Overall, the insurance average cost for a smoker is 32050.23$ while the average insurance cost for a non-smoker patient is 8434.27$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key parameter for determing the insurance cost is the number of children. There are 764 patients with one or more children and the average age is 39.8 years old.\n",
    "Number of patients with:\n",
    "  No child: 574\n",
    "  One child: 324\n",
    "  Two children: 240\n",
    "  More than two children: 200\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall the average insurance cost for each patient is 13270.42$.\n",
    "The minimum insurance cost is 1121.9$ and the maximum insurance cost is 63770.4$.\n",
    "These are the patient information for:\n",
    "  Minimum insurance cost:('18', 'male', '23.21', '0', 'no', 'southeast')\n",
    "  Maximum insurance cost:('54', 'female', '47.41', '0', 'yes', 'southeast')\n",
